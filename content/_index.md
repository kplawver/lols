I used to have a super simple site with a file listing of stupid funny images I collected from the internet.

That directory listing stopped working.  I procrastinated fixing it, and eventually gave up, switching over to [mltshp](https://mltshp.com/user/kplawver) for all my meme needs.

I decided I needed my own stupid corner of the internet for this stuff, and well, here we are.
